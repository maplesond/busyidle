# Breaking Kubernetes (and how to fix it)

### Daniel Mapleson

---

### Background

- Overconsuming resources in a kubernetes cluster can make it unusable

- Even if problem is initially isolated to a single node, this can cascade problems through the cluster

- How do we make sure this doesn't happen?

---

### Demo

- Deploy out a program

- Overconsume resources in a cluster

- *Hope I can rescue the cluster quickly!!!*

- Impose limits and redeploy (without breaking the cluster)

---

### Lessons Learnt

- Always:

  - Specify resource requests and limits for pods

  - Provision capable nodes; don't be too tight with VM size
    - Default with Azure is 1 core and 2.7GB mem available per node
    - Keep in mind worker nodes will have some memory pre-allocated for system and kubernetes tasks that you can't use: ~800MB.


- Consider:

  - Cluster auto-scaling

  - Set namespace default memory limits
  
  - For memory keep request and limit level the same and always a little higher than the app will use
    - However, having a higher limit allows for pod to have occasionally memory bursts

### More Lessons Learnt:

  - If using helm, "*helm delete --purge*" does not work when cluster is locked up
    - Use "*kubectl delete deployment ...*" instead

  - AKS is a PaaS offering from Microsoft
    - Manages your K8s master nodes for you
    - Provisions worker nodes
    - Limited flexibility to customise settings.
    - If anything goes badly wrong (i.e. lost nodes) you might need to pick up the phone to Microsoft support!
      - i.e. if you delete a node via "*kubectl delete node ...*" you can get out of sync with the AKS service.
      - A (not very good) solution without deleting the cluster is to scale back the nodes then expand out again
