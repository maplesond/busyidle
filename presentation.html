### Lessons Learnt

- Always specify resource request and limit values for every pods

- Monitoring and alerting is essential to identify problems before they occur
  
- Also consider:

  - Cluster auto-scaling (requires pod resource requests and limits to be set!)

  - Provising capable nodes; don't be too tight with VM size.  Keep in mind the default worker node from Azure (Standard_DS1_v2) only has 1 core and 2.7GB mem available to do work (3.5GB total).

  - Setting overall namespace resource *request*, *limit*, *min*, and *max* values.

  - Keeping memory request and limit level the same and always a little higher than the app will use.  (However, having a higher limit allows for pod to have occasionally memory bursts.)

---

### Recovering from node failure

This typically happens due to memory being overcommited

1. First type "*kubectl get po --all-namespaces -o wide*" to see state of pods and if these are specific to a node (look for pods in "*Unknown* state").

2. If there's a problem, try deleting deployments or pods that are running on that node

3. If that fails, start an internative shell running in the cluster then try *SSH*ing from there to the affected node.  If this works, kill any troublesome processes or consider restarting the node.

4. If that fails you probably need to delete a node via "*kubectl delete node ...*".  This can sometimes get out of sync with the AKS portal settings.  In that case you can try re-scaling the AKS cluster.

5. Failing that you need to pick up the phone to Microsoft support!
